About me
========

I am a junior scientist working at GNS Science, New Zealand, as a Hydrological Spatial Systems Analyst.
My current field of work includes standards-based web-services for groundwater data sharing, processing
and 3D/4D interactive geoscientific visualisation for a national groundwater research programme
(SMART Aquifer Characterisation [*]_) in New Zealand, where I develop an online data platform.

My research interests [*]_ lie in distributed computing under the premise of reliable data security, integrity and privacy/IP.
I don't exactly fit into one of the desired core aspects of either Earth Sciences, Computer Sciences or GI Science,
my work in the Geoscience Data Domain is one particular use case if you will, where my background in Computer Science is
applied to the business needs of the environmental scientists and governmental decision makers.

My PhD thesis with the title "A Context-based Groundwater Data Infrastructure" examines a networked and
open standards-based integration of storing, accessing and transformation of distributed hydrogeological data with domain specific
geocomputation processes in the interdisciplinary case study of groundwater research in New Zealand to design a Hydrogeology Infrastructure.
I have experience in building research prototypes and working in collaborative research projects through
my interdisciplinary engagement within the SMART project and my PhD work [*]_, [*]_, [*]_.
