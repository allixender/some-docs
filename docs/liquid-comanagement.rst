Liquid Co-Management
====================

A research programme linking govt policy processes and geosciences via an interactive democracy data platform
mixed co-management Atlas, smart processing scenario runner and liquid feedback proposal

**Liquid Co-management for NPS-FM** is my working title. Please excuse casual English and the obsessive focus on how to include datasets and models based on my PhD.
After some discussions with Stew we seem to have agreed that it is still a bit too early to try real-time modelling in the web,
but maybe interpret the"science model context thing" as the general issue that should be decided/voted on.

Executive Summary
-----------------

The responsibility of management of natural resources, in particular water, is delegated to
the Regional Councils by the Resource Management Act. Decisions regarding water
management are regulated through the National Policy Statement for Freshwater
Management, however those decisions need to be backed by thorough science and in
consultation with all stakeholders, be it Iwi, domestic or agricultural water users, or the
general public in regards to recreational services that water resources provide.

However, current policy and management decision processes follow a rigid procedure, 1) the
science to understand the resources, 2) a consultation process (if at all) about the plan how
to manage the resource and 3) the development of a long term strategy and policy decision.

The main concern that we’d like to address is the agility of that process. These steps follow
the traditional waterfall project management model. We hypothesize that this is due to the
limitations of current tools. Scientific models that aim to characterise the availability and of
natural resources and dynamics of environmental process are developed, possible impact
assessed and then described in reports for further use. The data and assumptions utilised in
the research process are limited snapshots in time, dependent on the quality of data
collection and curation processes, and scope and depth vary with available budget. Based
on the information from these reports resource managers discuss strategies how to manage
the water resources in reconciliation with demands. The consultation with users is again a
cost-intensive process, because it is time-consuming. Furthermore, assumptions e.g. limits
or local/regional differences in water allocation for the modelling process cannot be changed.

Thus, the consultation process is limited to one pre-decided scenario, which might not have
considered all important stakeholders (who are all important stakeholders anyway?). Thus, a
final management and policy decision is not satisfactory.
We propose research into an agile, aka “liquid resource management system”. Recent
advances in computer and web technologies allow dynamic exposure of datasets and
scientific software. We suggest to link data with models and a “delegated voting” mechanism
into an online resource management feedback system. Such an online platform would
provide the capabilities to run different scenarios transparently within a democratic
discussion forum. Through delegates stakeholders can have their interests represented in a
co-management approach which allows a close link of the resource managers with the
affected communities while having the current science at hand.

Background / Context
--------------------

*Context by detailing the state of knowledge in this field:*

Bryan Ford original Delegative Democracy draft from 2002, but was uncertain what scientific venue(s) it would be suitable
at the time. Bryan unfortunately didn't manage to get back to exploring and developing it in any rigorous scientific fashion.

  Delegative Democracy
  http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/deleg.pdf

However, he published a well cited informal blog post revisiting the idea and pointing to some of the interesting
developments since 2002:

  Delegative Democracy Revisited
  http://bford.github.io/2014/11/16/deleg.html

The closest academic work Bryan referred to as a reasonably serious, rigorous exploration of the topic of any kind
(and the *only* peer-reviewed and published work directly on the topic that by then was James Green-Armytage’s political-economic analysis:

  Direct Voting and Proxy Voting
  http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/proxy.pdf

Green-Armytage, J. (2015). Direct Voting and Proxy Voting. Constitutional Political Economy, 26(2), 190–220. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10602-014-9176-9

This paper took a first step at theoretically defining and analyzing the idea from a cost/benefit perspective,
but it’s only a first step and leaves a lot of unanswered questions and issues, and of does not contributes to the empirical space.

Helene Landemore, a colleague of Bryan in political science at Yale, has been interested in this and related "collective intelligence/decision-making"
topics for a while. She is working with Rob Reich and Lucy Bernholz at Stanford on some events in the near future exploring this and other related “digital democracy” topics.
One might try reaching out to any or all of them as additional points of contacts with more experience in the political and social sciences space.

Medium article:

Liquid Democracy is a new form for collective decision making that gives voters full
decisional control. Voters can either vote directly on issues, or they can delegate their voting
power to delegates (i.e. representatives) who vote on their behalf. Delegation can be domain
specific, which means that voters can delegate their voting power to different experts in
different domains.

This is in contrast with direct democracy, where participants are required to personally vote
on all issues; and in contrast with representative democracy, where participants vote for
representatives once in a certain election cycle and then never worry about voting anymore.

From the general goal of interoperable data discovery and sharing, SDIs and geoportals
evolved to integrated systems of systems, not only providing data, but also processing
routines and visualisations of the processed geospatial data to support science and
education as well as policy and decision making for particular environmental domains.

Once diverse data sets for hydro-climatological time series, soil coverage, land use,
elevation and geology data are available through the SDI, data processing can consequently
be migrated into and automated within the web. Thus, connecting SDI data provisioning and
web processing services to solve information needs allows non-GIS- experts the use of such
tools with recent data.

Aims and Objectives
-------------------

The overall goal and specific aims/objective(s) of the research.

Building a platform that:

1) data management, leveraging existing tools and standards i.e. LINZ/OGC, et al,
NEMS/Nemar, LAWA and catalogues, councils data and telemetry

2) can run scientific models, surface and groundwater flow, recharge, basic model, that can
be parameterised for scenarios like different water abstractions in different areas, possibly
nutrient loads(?)

3) consultation/decision forum platform based on Liquid Feedback / Liquid Democracy, to
interlink with data and models and keep track of older policy decisions and management
plans

4) Tikanga Maori could provide crucial new perspectives for the liquid virtual hui for example

The size of the team and the scope of the project will be limited by the available funding.
As recommendation is that other funding sources would provide something like 0.3-0.6 FTE for you plus something like 0.1-0.3 FTE
for one highly established mentor who would have to have a very good track record in the science.
The project team would also likely need to include a small number of hours like 0.05 FTE for
GNS staff that might include project mgmt and liaison officer for project review and connecting to NZ stakeholders,
and possibly someone to assist you with various technical components of the work.

Finding a willing and credible expert as a mentor is the main step to take next. The project scope still needs to be determined through consultation,
and it would be good to compare something like people's satisfaction with a management decision when that decision is based on 'traditional' democratic methods
(like a freshwater management committee or by a regional council) vs. the liquid democracy approach.

Naive hypothesis is that the acceptance of the decision will be better under liquid democracy... but the project would have to design the social science experiment
to prove or disprove this hypothesis, preferably ona quantitative basis(?).

Science Stretch and Novelty

Liquid Co-management social, political and Maori science novelty,
model web science scenarios technological novelty,

Potential Contribution to NZ Economic Growth and Links to NZ Businesses - how the
research aligns to the assessment criteria detailed in the CfP, including justification of the
New Zealand context and niche

Better decisions in resource management, obvious balancing satisfaction with decision
process because “everybody” actually had a say, transparency, education as scenarios are
visible online with explanations, encouraging public informed discussion about science,
transparency as old mistakes not be repeated

Side effect using data public and transparently education aspect for people to improve
computer and technical literacy and use data more

Detailed Methodology - the research plan (detailed methodology) – the hypothesis/ses
being tested, methodology being used, methods of analysis (this should cover the total
funding period and include contributions from collaborators, etc.)

Case study area (Horowhenua?, Waikato or Bay of Plenty?), iwi co-management interests,
councils, social/political science research in dynamics if such a system could be designed in
a way that it would be accepted tool.

Finding willing stakeholders to test-drive system and engage in dialogues.

Analysing dynamics of interaction through platform, and also designing the platform
according to iterative appropriate requirements (ease of use but of course within the
regiment of the desired interaction patterns)
