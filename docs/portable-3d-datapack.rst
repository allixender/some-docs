A Portable 3D Geoscience Datapack
=================================


Exec Summary
------------

A Web Service for generating interactive 3D visual models of geoscience data, that can be used in web sites, on mobile phones and tablets

Notes on Partners
-----------------

National and international interest to advance technologies to easily package and visualise 3D geoscientific data.
A workshop with NZP&M (MBIE) identified that the MBIE data packs for exploration block offers need a "lightweight" 3D visualisation tool
to view structures and raise investor interest as early as possible in the process.

The SAC aquifer visualisation tool was demonstrated in October last year. There is possibility spin-off technology service company.

However, anticipated levels of funding  may not be insufficient to complete the project.Regional councils might also be interested in
geothermal data transfer and visualisation, as well as for resource consenting. Sata models are also being developed for groundwater (OGC GWML2),
with an option of easily extend to petroleum and geothermal.

Proposed R&D capability building on virtual/digital landscapes using 3D/4D modelling and 3D underground visualisations.
Eg. basin scale geology and geophysics data would be very much wanted to improve investor attraction.
To develop my 3D research to a new "production" level that would blend with a Centre of Excellence for interactive 3D/4D environmental data visualisation.


GNS SDF
-------

The operationalization of the prototype 3D viewer from the SMART Aquifer Characterisation (SAC) programme from its current application in hydrogeology to
geoscience disciplines in the Petroleum Geosciences, Marine Geosciences and Geothermal departments would provide a new interactive platform for data and model representation for the
general public through simple multi-platform visualisation of geological structures, reservoirs, deposits or the likes.
The immediate novelty is that the process is not available at such general level yet. The innovation is that this is to become an easy network/web accessible resource
for visualisation across departments to enable immediate embedding of visual models in websites, mobile or tablet apps.

A Web Service for generating interactive 3D visual models of geoscience data.
To extend the 3D generation process with the GIS datasets and models that are used in hydrogeology to integrate with other GNS data sets.

Start Date:	October 2016
End Date:	December 2016

Method finalised and integrated into new web service. Expected Output: new website [Oct 2016-Dec 2016]

Interactive, lightweight 3D visualisation of geological and geoscience data in a web browser is becoming possible with recent technological advances.
However, the data preparation is challenging; it takes a lot of manual effort, and is very specific to a certain case study or geoscience discipline.
In my PhD I have developed a 3D scene generation method that reads directly from standard GIS and hydrogeological datasets and generates a 3D scene in
a so called 3D scene description format, eXtensible 3D (X3D, an internet standard).

Thus, it is a translation from domain data (geoscience datasets and models) into a visual declaration - the 3D scene, with 3D elements such as meshes,
and geometric surfaces etc. While this model format can be easily rendered in a web browser or a smartphone or a tablet, the translation process is not s
treamlined for general production purposes. Develope method that can encapsulate translation and 3D generation process into a standard web service,
which is currently working for basic hydrogeology, towards integration benefit for the Petroleum Basin Explorer (PBE).

The challenge is now to extend this method from the GIS datasets and models that are used in hydrogeology, and integrate with petroleum,
minerals and seismic datasets and models from geological modelling tools like GoCAD, Leapfrog or traditional seismic data formats like SEGY.
